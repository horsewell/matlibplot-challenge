## Module 5 Challenge - Matlibplot

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Process

- Data preparation
- Generate summary statistics
- Create bar charts related to the total mice for each drug reigmen
- Create pie charts related to the total of each sex of mice
- Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot of 4 of the drugs
- Create a line plot for the tumor of one of the mice against time
- Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the weight of the mice and the size of the tumor
- Calculate correlation and regression of the above relationship
- Final analysis of the various charts and tables
